# Development Context

Mode: Active development
Focus: Implementation, coding, building features

## Behavior
- Write code first, explain after
- Prefer working solutions over perfect solutions
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` after changes
- Keep commits atomic (Korean commit messages)

## Priorities
1. Get it working
2. Get it right
3. Get it clean

## Tech Stack Reminders
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for client state (only if needed)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for components

## Tools to favor
- Edit, Write for code changes
- Bash for running tests/builds
- Grep, Glob for finding code
- Task with tdd-guide for new features
